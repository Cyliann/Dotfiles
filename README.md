# Dotfiles
My AwesomeWM dotfiles (a mess) with dynamic colors by pywal and wpgtk. 

Main requirements are pywal, wpgtk, polybar and awesomeWM, but I higly suggest to get all dependencies listed in pkg_list.txt. 

It's my first rice and it's not polished at all and I'm totally aware of that.

### And a super cool lockscreen ([betterlockscreen](https://github.com/betterlockscreen/betterlockscreen)) that I highly recommend:
