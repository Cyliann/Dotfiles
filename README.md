# Dotfiles
My AwesomeWM dotfiles (a mess) with dynamic colors by pywal and wpgtk. 

Main requirements are pywal, wpgtk and awesomeWM, but I higly suggest to get all dependencies listed in pkg_list.txt. 

It's my first rice and it's not polished at all and I'm totally aware of that.



### Wallpapers and colorschemes:
